# There is a directory traversal vulnerability in the

# Write a script which will attempt various levels of directory
# traversal to find the right amount that will give access
# to the root directory. Inside will be a human.conf with the flag.
#
# Note: The script can timeout. If this occurs try narrowing
# down your search
